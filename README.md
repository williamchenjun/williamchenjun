## Welcome :wave:

<br>

My name is William Chen. I am Jr. Business Analyst intern at MESA s.r.l.. I have a Bachelor's degree in Mathematics (2019-2022)[^undergradprize] and a Master's degree in Data Science (2022-2023). It's hard to define what I like specifically. I mainly work on data handling and analysis.[^disclaimer]

### :computer: Programming Languages

I spend most of my time programming in SQL, JavaScript and Python.

### :file_folder: Projects

Some of the academic [projects](https://williamchenjun.github.io/projects/) I have worked on are:
- :busts_in_silhouette: U.S. 2016 Election Statistics (BSc)
- :bust_in_silhouette: Random Matrix Theory and The Riemann Hypothesis (BSc)
- :bust_in_silhouette: Disproportionality in Stop and Search Action in London (MSc)

I am always open to opportunities, so feel free to contact me on the socials linked on my profile or visit my [contacts page](https://williamchenjun.github.io/contacts/)! 

[^undergradprize]: [BSc Mathematics UG Prize](http://www.sussex.ac.uk/maths/ugstudy/ugprizes)
[^disclaimer]: While I am decent at programming, I have no expertise in using GitHub. Thus, excuse the messy repositories.
