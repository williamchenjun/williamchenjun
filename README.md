My name is William Chen. I am a postgraduate student at King's College London currently studying Data Science. I have a Bachelor's in Mathematics (2019-2022)[^undergradprize]. I like exploring different variety of fields when it comes to programming, however, I mainly deal with data.[^disclaimer]

### :computer: Programming Languages

I don't have a strong academic background in programming or computer science. Thus, I am mainly self-taught. I usually program in Python and JavaScript. However, I am also learning a different range of languages such as C#, PHP, and Julia.

### :file_folder: Projects

I haven't had the chance to work on any big individual projects outside of the academic environment yet. However, some of the projects I have worked on are:
- :busts_in_silhouette: U.S. 2016 Election Statistics (BSc)
- :bust_in_silhouette: Random Matrix Theory and The Riemann Hypothesis (BSc)
- :bust_in_silhouette: Disproportionality in Stop and Search Action in London (MSc - In progress)

I am always open to new acquaintances so feel free to contact me on the socials linked on my profile! 

[^undergradprize]: [BSc Mathematics UG Prize](http://www.sussex.ac.uk/maths/ugstudy/ugprizes)
[^disclaimer]: While I am decent at programming, I have no expertise in using GitHub. Thus, excuse the messy repositories.
