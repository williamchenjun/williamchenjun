My name is William Chen. I am a Data Scientist based in Italy. I have a Bachelor's degree in Mathematics (2019-2022)[^undergradprize] and a Master's degree in Data Science (2022-2023). I like exploring different variety of fields when it comes to programming, however, I mainly deal with data.[^disclaimer]

### :computer: Programming Languages

I spend most of my time programming in SQL, JavaScript and Python.

### :file_folder: Projects

I haven't had the chance to work on any big individual projects outside of the academic environment yet. However, some of the [projects](https://williamchenjun.github.io/projects/) I have worked on are:
- :busts_in_silhouette: U.S. 2016 Election Statistics (BSc)
- :bust_in_silhouette: Random Matrix Theory and The Riemann Hypothesis (BSc)
- :bust_in_silhouette: Disproportionality in Stop and Search Action in London (MSc)

I am always open to new acquaintances or job opportunities so feel free to contact me on the socials linked on my profile or visit my [contacts page](https://williamchenjun.github.io/contacts/)! 

[^undergradprize]: [BSc Mathematics UG Prize](http://www.sussex.ac.uk/maths/ugstudy/ugprizes)
[^disclaimer]: While I am decent at programming, I have no expertise in using GitHub. Thus, excuse the messy repositories.
